(If you thought this was completely useless/stupid, check out [iPhone Doom](http://code.google.com/p/iphonedoom/))

nervegas's version of the emulator can be found at http://iphone.natetrue.com/nesapp/.  It'd be nice if there was one central location, but...

A native NES emulator for the iPhone, currently using the [InfoNES](http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley/5604/infones/) core.

Video of the emulator in action can be viewed at http://youtube.com/watch?v=LVh429Dp7r0

Many thanks to stepwhite, nervegas, nightwatch, bwhiteman, dshadow, wheat-_and others._

Latest version is v0.31 available at http://iphonenes.googlecode.com/files/NES-0.31.zip

[ChangeLog](http://code.google.com/p/iphonenes/wiki/ChangeLog)

Presently there is ~~no sound~~ sound, but [requires killing mediaserverd](http://code.google.com/p/iphonenes/wiki/Sound).

And the [control is a bit iffy](http://code.google.com/p/iphonenes/wiki/ControllerAbnormalities) (using an image of an actual controller, while cute, sucks).

ROMs need to be placed in /var/root/Media/ROMs/NES

First screen listing the available ROMs:

Clicking on a ROM (so long as it's a valid ROM w/iNES header) takes you to the second screen, the emulator itself:

And many thanks to the #iphone-dev people, without whom none of this would be possible.
